INTRODUCTION                                             *minscm-introduction*

MinSCM is a plugin to manage your repositories of various SCM system (VCS).
MinSCM provides an abstract interface, so you can manage repositories without
being aware of differences between SCM systems.

Features:
  - Mercurial support
  - Git support
  - Bazaar support
  - Abstract interface
  - Many commands
  - Syntax highlighting for status and diff in commit buffer.
  - Syntax highlighting for annotate buffer
  - Completion of revision/branch names
  - Completion of locations for pull/push
  - Repositories report on status line
  - Collaboration with Fuzzyfinder plugin


==============================================================================
INSTALLATION                                             *minscm-installation*

Put all files into your runtime directory. If you have the zip file, extract
it to your runtime directory.

You should place the files as follows:
>
        <your runtime directory>/plugin/minscm.vim
        <your runtime directory>/autoload/minscm.vim
        <your runtime directory>/autoload/minscm/mercurial.vim
        ...
<
And then update your help tags files to enable MinSCM help. See
|add-local-help| for details.

                                                        *g:minscm_getStatus()*
To Show Repositories Information In Status Line ~

Use g:minscm_getStatus(). (see also: |'statusline'|)

                                                          *minscm-fuzzyfinder*
Fuzzyfinder Plugin ~

MinSCM uses APIs of fuzzyfinder.vim. Following commands are dependent on
fuzzyfinder.vim:

        If repositories of more than one SCM systems are found, the repository
        of SCM system which appears before others in g:minscm_availableScms
        has a priority.
